## Info

The purpose of this assignment was to develop a quiz bank like web application that provides a comprehensive and user-friendly 
platform for creating, managing and taking quizzes for educational, training, or entertainment purposes.


## How to run the application

### Prerequisites

To run this program you need:

- JDK 17
- Maven
- Docker
- Node version 16 or higher
- npm

### Installation and execution

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git@gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no:full-stack-a-team/quiz-academy.git
   ```

#### Running the backend

The backend can be run through a dockerfile:

1. Build the dockerfile
   ```sh
   docker build -t quizacademyapplication .
   ```

2. Execute the dockerfile on port 8080
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 quizacademyapplication
   ```

> Note that this needs to be done within the network of NTNU, because the backend accesses the database which is hosted within a virtual machine.

#### Running the frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder
   ```sh
   cd quizAcademyFrontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

> Don't forget to have the backend running!
